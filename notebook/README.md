This documentation explains the workflow of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline used for question-answering based on a collection of PDFs. The approach leverages LangChain, Pinecone, Cohere, GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings, and Groq models to deliver an end-to-end solution for document-based question answering.

## 1. Overview of the Pipeline
The RAG pipeline consists of several key stages:

- **Document Loading:** Loading PDFs from a directory.
- **Chunking:** Splitting documents into smaller chunks for efficient processing.
- **Vector Store Creation:** Generating embeddings and storing them in a Pinecone vector database.
- **Retrieval:** Searching for relevant document chunks based on a query.
- **Reranking:** Reordering search results based on relevance using Cohere.
- **Generative Answering:** Producing a final answer using LLM api in combination with the retrieved chunks.

## 2. Model Architecture
The architecture follows a modular approach with distinct components for each step of the pipeline:

- **GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings:** Its embedding-001 model is used to generate embeddings (numerical representations) from text chunks. Embeddings are crucial for representing the document chunks in a form that can be efficiently searched and retrieved based on the query.

- **Pinecone Vector Database:** Pinecone stores the document embeddings in a vector database, allowing fast and scalable similarity searches. A document is represented as a set of vectors, and relevant documents are retrieved based on the cosine similarity between the query and the stored vectors.

- **Cohere Reranking:** Once the relevant documents are retrieved, they are reranked using the Cohere model (rerank-english-v3.0) to ensure that the most relevant chunks are prioritized. This step enhances the accuracy of the retrieval process by applying a more nuanced relevance model.

- **Groq api for Generative Model:** Finally, the Groq api model (Llama3-8b-8192) takes the reranked results and produces a coherent and concise answer to the user's query. The model is optimized for generative tasks and responds based on the relevant content retrieved.

## 3. Pipeline Stages
### 1. Document Loading:
- The function **load_documents()** is responsible for loading all PDFs from a given directory.
- Each PDF is converted into a document format that can be processed in later stages.

### 2. Document Chunking:
- The loaded documents are split into smaller chunks using the **chunk_documents()** function.
- This is necessary to handle large documents and ensure each chunk fits within the model's context window.

### 3. Vector Store Creation:

- The **create_vector_store()** function creates a vector database using Pinecone.
- Documents are converted into embeddings using the embedding model, and these embeddings are stored in Pinecone for fast retrieval.

### 4. Querying and Retrieval:
- The **retrieve_answers()** function handles the retrieval process.
- Given a user query, the function performs a similarity search in the Pinecone vector store, returning the top relevant chunks.

### 5. Reranking:
- The search results are reranked by the **rerank_results_with_cohere()** function using Cohere's rerank model.
- Documents are reordered based on relevance to ensure that the most pertinent chunks are presented first.

### 6. Answer Generation:

- Finally, the **qa_chain** combines the reranked chunks and the query to produce a natural language response using the Groq’s api model.
- The response is generated by applying Llama3 model on the relevant document chunks.

## 4. Flow of Execution
1. **API Key Setup:** API keys for Pinecone, Cohere, Google Generative AI, and Groq are initialized.

2. **Document Loading:** The pipeline starts by loading the PDFs from a specified folder (eg. /content/Sample Pdfs).

3. **Chunking:** Documents are chunked into smaller sections, ensuring that the content is manageable for embedding generation and retrieval.

4. **Vector Store Initialization:** Pinecone is initialized with a specified index (langcha), which stores document embeddings.

5. **Search and Reranking:** A user’s query is input, and the Pinecone index is queried to return k relevant documents. Cohere then reranks these results based on relevance.

6. **Answer Generation:** Using the reranked documents, the Groq api model generates an answer based on the most relevant content.

## 6. Example
**Query:** "Which are requirements in RAG QA-Bot task?"

**Pipeline Output:**

- The pipeline searches the vector database for relevant document chunks.
- These chunks are reranked using Cohere.
- Groq api’s generative model produces a final answer based on the most relevant document chunks.

## 7. Conclusion
This RAG pipeline effectively combines retrieval and generation, leveraging the strengths of Pinecone, Cohere, and Groq. The modular design allows flexibility in customizing each component, enabling improvements or changes based on the task's needs.

This system is well-suited for tasks requiring efficient document-based question-answering, particularly in scenarios involving large PDF datasets.
